# RPS_Robot
Goal:
To create a robot that beats humans 100% of the time in the game of rock-paper-scissors real-time.

Details: 
This project uses a feed-forward neural network which is trained/can be trained using images in the form of float vectors. 
The methods in python module named NeuralNet.py can be used to create a new neural network object, train a neural-net, get output from the network, and set the weights and biases in the network. The test data used to train the network can be found in the folder Training Data. Currently, the training data is only of images where the hand of the player's hand enters the view of the camera from the right side.
